  shortDescription: Receipts for exotic animals
  analysedDescription: The receipts include a recent purchase for a <color=orange>black
    mamba snake</color>
  fullDescription: Looking at the WInston's manor you would not have questioned the
    receipts for exotic animals. Almost every room features a taxidermied animal.
    But the recent purchase of a highly venomous snake was suspicious. The animal
    is nowhere to be found and there is no where for it to have been kept.
