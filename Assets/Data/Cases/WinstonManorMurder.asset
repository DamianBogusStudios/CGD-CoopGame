  fullDescription: Mrs. Winston, Mr. Winston's wife, is the prime suspect. Despite
    a facade of social grace and philanthropy, Coral's private turmoil, stemming
    from her volatile marriage and financial desperation, paints a starkly different

    combined with the discovery of incriminating items among her belongings and inconsistencies
    in her alibi, culminate in a compelling case against her. Coral's motive. After
    finding the victim's will, Mrs. Winston was inconsolable and lashed out in a
    fit of rage.
